# Linear Regression

Linear Regression is one of the easiest and popular Machine Learning algorithms. It is a Supervised Learning that supports finding the linear correlation between variables.

Linear Regression performs the task to predict a dependent variables value(y) based on a given independent variables(X). It predict using linear equation or Hypothesis function.

where 
θ<sub>0</sub> : y intercept and
θ<sub>1</sub> : Coefficient of x

#### How to upate θ<sub>0</sub> and θ<sub>1</sub> values to get the best fit line?
There is limitation in linear regression that is it assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables and dependent variable, which may not always be the case. Linear Regression is sensitive to Outliers, or data points that are significantly from the rest of the data.

#### Cost Function(J): 
Also Known as "Squared Error Function"  or "Mean Squared error" we can measure the accuracy of our Hypothesis function by using a cost function. This takes an average difference of all the results of the Hypothesis with inputs from x's and the actual output y's
